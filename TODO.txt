x holes for programmer pins (at least 5): 25 mil (0.635 mm)
x when EWMA is still -1, UI reads -50.1 °C
- update V-USB?
x measure and calculate humidity
x add LED?
x add capaciator to TMP36? No, there is already a 100nF and 10uF - but it still
  seems to make readings more stable with the suboptimal test circuit...
- document fuses to set (lfuse:w:0xe1:m)
x pull-up unconnected pins
- try ADC Noise Reduction mode
- try debugging
- recalibrate oscillator every n minutes to account for frequency shifts 
  caused by significant temperature changes (20°C -> 40°C causes frequent
  I/O-errors, reconnecting resolves that)
